FUTURE DEVELOPEMENT IDEAS
One of the features that of the client suggested was adding gamification elements 
into the application in order to motivate users to save money. 
These gamification elements could include setting savings targets, sending motivational messages to users, 
and re-warding users with a star icon upon achieving their goals.

In addition, the client also proposed the idea of an account-type report view for the ap-plication. 
This report view would display the selected month with dates, as well as all the 
events logged to each of the respective dates. 
The aim was to help users plan their budgeting more efficiently, 
by providing insights into when they had expenses and when they could expect income. 
This feature was designed to address the issue of users having to pay rent or bills on 
specific dates, despite not receiving income until a later date.
